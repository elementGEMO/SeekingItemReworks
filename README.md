# Seeking Item Reworks
A mod focused entirely on reworking mostly Seekers of the Storm items, either by slight number adjustments to completely new functionalities. This mod is extremely configurable, down to the numbers and just straight up rework disable.

Each item is easily configurable to almost each of their stacks, and base numbers, and other miscellaneous effects like optional visual effects.
## Main Reworks
- These are the main items that are reworked or modified.
- As I repeat, can be heavily configurated.

| Item / Equipment Tier  | Item Name | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------------- |
| Common | Warped Echo | Incoming non-lethal damage is split 50%, with the other 50% delayed for 3s (+1.5s per stack). Recharges when damage is no longer delayed. _**- Basically can't kill you anymore.**_
| Common | Chronic Expansion | Killing 5 enemies in combat buffs damage by 7% (+5% per stack) temporarily each time, until leaving combat. _**- No longer misleading stacking.**_
| Common | Knockback Fin | 5% (+2% per stack) chance on hit to knock enemies into the air. Deal +10% (+10% per stack) damage to airborne enemies. _**- Now mostly anti-air playstyle.**_
| Common | Antler Shield | Increase armor by 5% (+5% per stack) of current movement speed. Increase movement speed  by 7% (+3.5% per stack). _**- Focused on gaining more armor through speed.**_
| Uncommon | Unstable Transmitter | Falling below 25% health causes you to fade away, becoming intangible and exploding, inflicting bleed to enemies within 30m for 100% (+50% per stack) base damage. Lasts 2s (+0.5s per stack). Recharges every 60 seconds. _**- Scales on the player's base damage, not proc-coefficient. Also is more damage than Old War Stealthkit.**_
| Legendary | War Bonds | Gain 3 (+2 per stack) free purchases at the start of each stage. When making a gold purchase, get 20% (+10% per stack) of spent gold as experience. _**- Makes War Bonds actually worth while, and excels early on for more experience gains.**_
| Equipment | Seed of Life | Returns the user to life upon death or dead allies on use. Equipment is consumed on use. _**- Just rewriting the description, nothing is changed otherwise**_
## Soft Reworks
- These are the miscellaneous items that are reworked or modified.
- These changes can only be toggled for the time being.

| Item / Equipment Tier  | Item Name | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------------- |
| Uncommon | Old War Stealthkit | Falling below 25% health causes you to become invisible for 5 seconds, boost movement speed by 40%, and cleanse 2 debuffs (+1 per stack). Recharges every 30 seconds (-50% per stack). _**- Makes it on par with Unstable Transmitter rework**_
| Legendary | Ben's Raincoat | _**- Uh, there's no actual change to Ben's Raincoat. Really, all there is, is that False Son's Skill Disable debuff can now be cleansed.**_
## Foreseeable Plans
Well duh, I'd still be frequently working on these item reworks. I plan to touch all of the Seekers of the Storm items. Maybe at some point, I'd touch other item reworks as well. Depends on my motivation and all.
